 * COMPILATION ENVIRONMENTS
 *
 * DEFAULT	By default newly complied code will get POSIX APIs plus
 *		Apple API extensions in scope.
 *
 *		Most users will use this compilation environment to avoid
 *		behavioural differences between 32 and 64 bit code.
 *
 * LEGACY	Defining _NONSTD_SOURCE will get pre-POSIX APIs plus Apple
 *		API extensions in scope.
 *
 *		This is generally equivalent to the Tiger release compilation
 *		environment, except that it cannot be applied to 64 bit code;
 *		its use is discouraged.
 *
 *		We expect this environment to be deprecated in the future.
 *
 * STRICT	Defining _POSIX_C_SOURCE or _XOPEN_SOURCE restricts the
 *		available APIs to exactly the set of APIs defined by the
 *		corresponding standard, based on the value defined.
 *
 *		A correct, portable definition for _POSIX_C_SOURCE is 200112L.
 *		A correct, portable definition for _XOPEN_SOURCE is 600L.
 *
 *		Apple API extensions are not visible in this environment,
 *		which can cause Apple specific code to fail to compile,
 *		or behave incorrectly if prototypes are not in scope or
 *		warnings about missing prototypes are not enabled or ignored.
 *
 * In any compilation environment, for correct symbol resolution to occur,
 * function prototypes must be in scope.  It is recommended that all Apple
 * tools users add etiher the "-Wall" or "-Wimplicit-function-declaration"
 * compiler flags to their projects to be warned when a function is being
 * used without a prototype in scope.
 */

/*
 * The __DARWIN_ALIAS macros are used to do symbol renaming; they allow
 * legacy code to use the old symbol, thus maintiang binary compatability
 * while new code can use a standards compliant version of the same function.
 *
 * __DARWIN_ALIAS is used by itself if the function signature has not
 * changed, it is used along with a #ifdef check for __DARWIN_UNIX03
 * if the signature has changed.  Because the __LP64__ enviroment
 * only supports UNIX03 sementics it causes __DARWIN_UNIX03 to be
 * defined, but causes __DARWIN_ALIAS to do no symbol mangling.
 *
 * As a special case, when XCode is used to target a specific version of the
 * OS, the manifest constant __ENVIRONMENT_MAC_OS_X_VERSION_MIN_REQUIRED__
 * will be defined by the compiler, with the digits representing major version
 * time 100 + minor version times 10 (e.g. 10.5 := 1050).  If we are targetting
 * pre-10.5, and it is the default compilation environment, revert the
 * compilation environment to pre-__DARWIN_UNIX03.

 * The rune type below is declared to be an ``int'' instead of the more natural
 * ``unsigned long'' or ``long''.  Two things are happening here.  It is not
 * unsigned so that EOF (-1) can be naturally assigned to it and used.  Also,
 * it looks like 10646 will be a 31 bit standard.  This means that if your
 * ints cannot hold 32 bits, you will be in trouble.  The reason an int was
 * chosen over a long is that the is*() and to*() routines take ints (says
 * ANSI C), but they use __darwin_ct_rune_t instead of int.  By changing it
 * here, you lose a bit of ANSI conformance, but your programs will still
 * work.
 *
 * NOTE: rune_t is not covered by ANSI nor other standards, and should not
 * be instantiated outside of lib/libc/locale.  Use wchar_t.  wchar_t and
 * rune_t must be the same type.  Also wint_t must be no narrower than
 * wchar_t, and should also be able to hold all members of the largest
 * character set plus one extra value (WEOF). wint_t must be at least 16 bits.

     Copyright:  (c) 2001-2005 by Apple Computer, Inc., all rights reserved.

     More Info:  See TechNote 2064

     Contains:   Double-underbar-prefixed availability macros, derived from
                 AvailabilityMacros.h

                 This header enables a developer to specify build time
                 constraints on what Mac OS X versions the resulting
                 application will be run.  There are two bounds a developer
                 can specify:
                 
                      __MAC_OS_X_VERSION_MIN_REQUIRED
                      __MAC_OS_X_VERSION_MAX_ALLOWED
                      
                The lower bound controls which calls to OS functions will 
                be weak-importing (allowed to be unresolved at launch time).
                The upper bound controls which OS functionality, if used,
                will result in a compiler error because that functionality is
                not available on on any OS is the specifed range.
                
                For example, suppose an application is compiled with:
                
                      __MAC_OS_X_VERSION_MIN_REQUIRED = __MAC_OS_X_VERSION_10_2
                      __MAC_OS_X_VERSION_MAX_ALLOWED  = __MAC_OS_X_VERSION_10_3
                     
                and an OS header contains:
                
                     extern void funcA(void) __AVAILABLE_MAC_OS_X_VERSION_10_0_AND_LATER;

/* Darwin has the pthread routines in libSystem, which every program
   links to, so there's no need for weak-ness for that.  */


// On Darwin, in order to enable overriding of operator new and delete,
// GCC makes the definition of these functions weak, relies on the
// loader to implement weak semantics properly, and uses
// -flat_namespace to work around the way that it doesn't.

// Allow use of the GNU syntax extension, "extern template." This

// are already explicitly instantiated in the library binary. This
// substantially reduces the binary size of resulting executables.




// Certain function definitions that are meant to be overridable from

// This file provides some compile-time information about various types.
// These representations were designed, on purpose, to be constant-expressions
// and not types as found in <bits/type_traits.h>.  In particular, they
// can be used in control structures and the optimizer hopefully will do
// the obvious thing.
//
// Why integral expressions, and not functions nor types?
// Firstly, these compile-time entities are used as template-arguments
// so function return values won't work:  We need compile-time entities.
// We're left with types and constant  integral expressions.
// Secondly, from the point of view of ease of use, type-based compile-time
// information is -not- *that* convenient.  On has to write lots of
// overloaded functions and to hope that the compiler will select the right
// one. As a net effect, the overall structure isn't very clear at first
// glance.
// Thirdly, partial ordering and overload resolution (of function templates)
// is highly costly in terms of compiler-resource.  It is a Good Thing to
// keep these resource consumption as least as possible.
//
// See valarray_array.h for a case use.
